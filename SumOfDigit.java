/*Find the sum of digits of a given number

		Pseudo code:
		* Declare your input number (int)
		* Initialize an integer variable by name: sum
		* Use loop to calculate the sum: which loop to use until the number goes greater than 0??
		* Within loop: get the remainder when done by 10 -> Tip: use mod operator( % )
		* Print the remainder to confirm
		* Within loop: add that remainder to the sum
		* Print the sum to confirm	
		* Within loop: get quotient of that number (tip: quotient should be same variable of loop condition)	
		* Print the quotient to confirm		
		* Outside the loop: print the final sum
